<h1>The Best Movies according to Alberto</h1>
<h2>My Top 4 Best Movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Seven</h3>
<p>
  One of the best detective stories writen for a movie. With two magnificent
  actors like Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt and a great eerie atmosphere. <br />
  The end of this movie is simply shocking and it will be one of the best
  plot-twist of the cinema history.
</p>
<h3>Alien</h3>
<p>
  What can we say about this film. The masterpiece of the Science Fiction writen
  by Ridley Scott that put the cinema industry upside down and I always
  recommend. Watch out with the alien!
</p>
<h3>Pride and Prejudice</h3>
<p>
  If you love the love stories, this is, definitively, one of the best ones.
  With a great soundtrack that goes with the adventures that our two main
  characters have to get through.
</p>
<h3>Blade Runner</h3>
<p>
  This is another great title borned in the 80s that makes the difference in
  terms of Science Fiction. Harrison Ford is this main character and the
  ashtonished soundtrack made by Vangelis makes this film unmatched.
